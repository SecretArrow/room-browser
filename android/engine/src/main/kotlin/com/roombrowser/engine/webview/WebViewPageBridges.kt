/**
 * The two native entry points a page script can reach in the WebView edition,
 * and how their calls are spelled on the way up.
 *
 * WHY THE ENGINE OWNS THESE AT ALL. Above the facade the app may not name a
 * `WebView`: `EngineSession.view` is a `View` and hosts are forbidden from
 * downcasting it, so `addJavascriptInterface` is not something the app can
 * still reach. The two `@JavascriptInterface` objects the app used to build in
 * `BrowserViewModel.createWebView` (BrowserViewModel.kt:1304-1326) therefore
 * move down into the session and report upward through
 * [com.roombrowser.engine.EngineSessionListener.onPageMessage], which is the
 * facade's stated transport replacement for `@JavascriptInterface` and
 * GeckoView ports alike.
 *
 * WHAT MOVED UP WITH THE CALLBACKS, and must NOT be re-implemented here: the
 * host validation, the rate limiting and the "no argument is ever logged"
 * discipline that `RoomVaultBridge` (WebClients.kt:736-826) and `WalletBridge`
 * (wallet/dapp/WalletBridge.kt:91) apply. Those are decisions about the user's data and
 * they belong above the facade, where the session's own
 * [com.roombrowser.engine.EngineSession.url] is available as the anchor -- the
 * facade says so in as many words. All that is left down here is the transport.
 *
 * THE PAGE-VISIBLE COLLISION SURFACE IS PRESERVED EXACTLY. Each object is a
 * SEPARATE `addJavascriptInterface` registration rather than one object
 * installed twice, because registering one class under two names would expose
 * every public method under both -- `window.RoomVault.request` would exist,
 * and `window.RoomWallet.requestCredentials` with it. The app's contract is
 * that each global exposes only its own two (or one) methods.

 * `window.RoomVault`: the password manager's page-callable half.
 *
 * The two methods are the app's own protocol (`RoomVaultBridge`,
 * WebClients.kt:763-797) and their signatures are reproduced exactly, because
 * the injected script `RoomVaultScript.SCRIPT` calls them by name and by
 * arity: `requestCredentials(location.host, location.href)` and
 * `reportCredential(location.host, username, password)`. The PAGE-VISIBLE wire
 * does not change by a byte; what changes is only where the arguments go.
 *
 * THE PAYLOAD ENVELOPE IS AN INTERPRETATION. `onPageMessage` carries one
 * `channel` and one `payload` string, while these two methods carry two and
 * three arguments respectively -- and the same channel has to serve both. So
 * each call is encoded as a JSON object naming the method and its arguments:
 *
 *   {"method":"requestCredentials","host":"...","href":"..."}
 *   {"method":"reportCredential","host":"...","username":"...","password":"..."}
 *
 * The alternative -- a bare positional JSON array -- was rejected because the
 * receiving side could not tell the two calls apart without counting
 * arguments. Nothing is lost either way: every argument arrives as the exact
 * string the page passed, or as JSON null when the page passed null (which the
 * native bridge also had to tolerate; `requestCredentials(null, ...)` returned
 * early).
