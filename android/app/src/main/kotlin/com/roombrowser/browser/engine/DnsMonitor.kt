/**

 * Android WebView resolves its own traffic through the OS network stack —
 * a normal third-party app cannot force WebView to use a custom resolver.
 * The configuration here protects the app's OWN connections (public-IP
 * check, search suggestions, downloads), and only ever does so through DoH:
 * OkHttp has no DNS-over-TLS transport, so a DoT hostname is validated and
 * surfaced as a recommendation (turn on OS Private DNS) but is NOT enforced
 * — see the DoT note on [buildDoh].
 * It does NOT claim to protect WebView page loads.
