/**
 * How a provider is asked to call tools.
 *
 * Native tool calling is the OpenAI/Anthropic `tools` array, and it is what a
 * capable model wants: the provider constrains the reply and the call arrives
 * structured. But it is not universal — some gateways reject the field
 * outright ("does not support tools"), some silently drop it and answer in
 * prose, and a small or heavily-quantised model may hold the schema worse than
 * it holds a sentence. In every one of those cases the agent used to be stuck:
 * `tools` was the only channel, so a provider that refused it could describe an
 * action but never take one.
 *
 * So there are two channels and a way to pick between them:
 *
 *  - [NATIVE] — send `tools`, read `tool_calls`. Streaming is preserved.
 *  - [TEXT] — send no `tools` at all; the catalogue and the calls travel as
 *    text under [LocalToolProtocol]'s contract.
 *  - [AUTO] (the default) — try native, and fall back to text the moment the
 *    provider says it cannot take tools.
 *
 * The stored spelling is the enum name, so a new constant needs no migration.

/**
 * Teaches tool calling to a gateway that does not have it.
 *
 * Wraps any [AgentGateway] and, per [ToolMode], either gets out of the way or
 * re-expresses the turn in text — the conversation is rewritten by
 * [LocalToolProtocol.messagesFor] (contract and catalogue appended to the
 * system message, `tool` results relabelled, assistant calls re-rendered), the
 * `tools` array is dropped, and the reply is read back with
 * [LocalToolProtocol.parseReply]. A reply that asks for a tool becomes a
 * [ChatMessage] with `toolCalls`, exactly as a native one would, so the agent
 * loop cannot tell the difference and needs no change.
 *
 * This is what makes "every provider can call tools" true rather than
 * aspirational: the identity of the provider stops mattering, because the
 * contract is carried by the conversation instead of by the wire.
 *
 * TEXT is not free, and the trade is deliberate:
 *
 *  - the delegate's answer is BUFFERED rather than streamed, because a call is
 *    only recognisable once the whole object has arrived. In TEXT mode the
 *    chat bubble fills in at the end of the turn instead of token by token;
 *  - the model must follow the contract by instruction. A model that ignores
 *    it produces prose, which is read as an answer — the same outcome as a
 *    native model that ignores `tools`. AUTO cannot rescue that case either;
 *    it is what TEXT mode is for when a model merely writes the call badly.
