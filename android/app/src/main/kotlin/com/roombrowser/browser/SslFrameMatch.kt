/**
 * Which frame a failing certificate belongs to.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: `onReceivedSslError` is the one WebView callback that does
 * not say which frame it fired for — an `SslError` carries a url and nothing
 * else. Without a discriminator, a single third-party sub-resource with a
 * broken certificate (an ad iframe, a tracker pixel, a CDN with an expired
 * cert) replaced an otherwise perfectly good page with the full-screen
 * "Connection Not Secure" error — the reported symptom, and not something any
 * other browser does: Chrome blocks the one resource and keeps the page.
 *
 * It lives here, apart from the WebView client that calls it, for one reason:
 * this is a decision about the user's safety that can only be pinned by
 * testing it, and `android.net.Uri` cannot be exercised in a JVM unit test.
 * [java.net.URI] can — and it is the more honest parser of the two anyway.
 * `Uri.parse` never fails: it returns a `Uri` with a null scheme for input
 * that is not a url at all, so the "unparseable" branch this decision depends
 * on [java.net.URI] to reach was unreachable in the old code.

     * Whether a certificate failure for [failingUrl] belongs to the main
     * frame, given the last main-frame url seen ([mainFrameUrl]) and the

     *
     * Compares SCHEME + HOST + PORT. Port is included because a service on
     * another port of the same host can present a different certificate;
     * scheme is included because an https sub-resource under an http page is
     * a different origin with a different certificate.
     *
     * An unparseable failing url answers TRUE — treat it as a main frame. So
     * does one that matches nothing we have recorded about any main frame,
     * which is the case on a first navigation that fails before the callbacks
     * that record one have run.
     *
     * The safe direction to be wrong in: a false "main frame" shows the user
     * an error page they can act on, while a false "sub-resource" would
     * silently swallow a failed navigation and leave the old page on screen
     * with no explanation at all. The asymmetry is the whole argument — one
     * costs a retry, the other costs the truth.
