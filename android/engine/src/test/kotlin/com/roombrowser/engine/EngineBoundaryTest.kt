/**
 * Fails the build if any module other than `:engine` names a rendering engine.
 *
 * WHY THIS TEST EXISTS. `:app` depends on this module as `implementation`, not
 * `api`, so no `org.mozilla.geckoview` type is on its compile classpath -- the
 * app *cannot* compile code that branches on which engine it runs. That is the
 * property the two-edition plan rests on: everything above the facade is
 * byte-identical between the WebView edition and the GeckoView edition, so a
 * feature added once lands in both by copying files rather than by rewriting
 * them.
 *
 * A Gradle dependency is a one-line change, though, and the failure it causes
 * is silent in the direction that matters: someone reaching for a GeckoView
 * convenience would first have to flip `implementation` to `api`, and nothing
 * would object. This test objects. It is the difference between "the boundary
 * is intended" and "the boundary is enforced".
 *
 * BOTH ENGINES ARE BANNED, not just the one that has a compile-classpath guard
 * already. `android.webkit` needs no `api` flip to reappear -- it is on every
 * Android classpath -- so nothing but this test stands between a future
 * `WebView` convenience and an app that compiles against one engine again. The
 * conversion just finished removed every such import; this keeps them removed.
 * (A STRING that merely names a class, like the androidTest probe that locates
 * the engine view by `By.clazz("android.webkit.WebView")`, is not an import and
 * does not trip this -- deliberately, since that probe is a black-box question
 * about what is on screen, not a dependency on the type.)
 *
 * It scans source text rather than compiled classes because the violation is
 * legible at the point it is written, and because it needs no classpath -- so
 * it runs in milliseconds as part of the ordinary unit-test task.
