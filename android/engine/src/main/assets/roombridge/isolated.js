/*
 * Room Browser bridge -- ISOLATED WORLD half.
 *
 * The only half that can hold a native port. It owns one port to the app and
 * is a two-way pump between it and main.js:
 *
 *   native  --port-->  isolated.js  --postMessage-->  main.js  -->  page
 *   native  <--port--  isolated.js  <--postMessage--  main.js  <--  page
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `all_frames`: one port per document is what the app-side
 * bookkeeping assumes, and a port per iframe would multiply the eval
 * round-trips and the pending-result map for no gain -- the page-world half
 * already runs in every frame for the shim's sake, and it is the frame that
 * needs evaluating, not this one.
 *
 * There is no background page. A content-script port is already routed to the
 * per-session MessageDelegate on the app side, so a background page would add
 * a hop and a lifecycle to manage while changing nothing about where the
 * message lands.
