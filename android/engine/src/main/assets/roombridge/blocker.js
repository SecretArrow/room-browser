/*
 * Room Browser bridge -- SUB-RESOURCE BLOCKER half.
 *
 * The only place in this app where a sub-resource request can be CANCELLED
 * under GeckoView. Android WebView reports every sub-resource to
 * `WebViewClient.shouldInterceptRequest`, so the WebView edition decides in the
 * app; GeckoView has no per-request callback at all, and the only hook that can
 * cancel one is `webRequest.onBeforeRequest` with `["blocking"]`, which is
 * JavaScript running in the extension process.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS RATHER THAN A CALL INTO THE APP. A blocking listener
 * must answer SYNCHRONOUSLY -- it returns the decision, it cannot await one --
 * so there is no way to ask the app's FilterEngine what to do. The rules
 * therefore travel here (the app pushes them over the native port below) and
 * the matching is mirrored. [decide] below is a step-for-step transcription of
 * `FilterEngine.decide` in `android/core/domain/.../FilterEngine.kt`; the two
 * must be changed together. The DATA they match against is NOT duplicated --
 * every host arrives from the app, which reads the one bundled list -- so the
 * two editions cannot disagree about what is blocked, only (at worst) about a
 * detail of the control flow written out twice here.
 *
 * THIS FILE IS AN ASSET, NOT CODE THE COMPILER SEES. Nothing in the build
 * checks it and no unit test can execute it: the JVM unit-test classpath has no
 * JS engine. So it is written to be read, and `BlockerScriptsTest` pins the
 * strings that cross between it and the Kotlin that answers it.
