/**
 * NATIVE half of the password-manager page bridge, exposed to page JS as
 * `window.RoomVault` (see [RoomVaultScript] for the injected half).
 *
 * PROTOCOL (what page JS can call — nothing else is exported):
 *  - `RoomVault.requestCredentials(location.host, location.href)` — the user
 *    focused/tapped a password field. No values are returned to the page; the
 *    native side decides whether to surface an "offer" sheet at all.
 *  - `RoomVault.reportCredential(location.host, username, password)` — a
 *    login form containing a non-empty password was submitted: the DOM
 *    submit event, a submit-control click, Enter in the password field, a
 *    scripted form submit(), or a request sent in the window after a vault
 *    fill (see [RoomVaultScript]). Observational only; nothing is stored
 *    until the user taps "Save" on the prompt sheet.
 *
 * HOW THE CALLS ARRIVE NOW. There is no `@JavascriptInterface` on this side
 * any more, in either edition: the page reaches native code through the
 * engine's own page bridge and the call surfaces as
 * [RoomSessionListener.onPageMessage], carrying the channel this object is
 * registered under ([PageBridgeChannels.VAULT]). [onMessage] unpacks the
 * envelope and routes it to the same two handlers the old interface exposed,
 * so the PAGE-VISIBLE wire — two method names, their arity, their argument
 * order — does not change by a byte. Only where the arguments come from does.
 *
 * SECURITY MODEL — the bridge never trusts the page:
 *  1. Only the two methods named in the envelope are reachable; anything else
 *     the page sends on this channel is dropped.
 *  2. Every call is validated ON THE MAIN THREAD against the session's own
 *     current URL — [EngineSession.url], the facade's documented TRUST
 *     ANCHOR, which is written only from a top-level navigation and never
 *     from the page. The host the page CLAIMS must match the host family of
 *     what the session is actually showing (CredentialDomainMatcher, equal or
 *     parent/child). The host handed to the callbacks is always the session's
 *     authoritative one, so a page can never obtain or report credentials
 *     attributed to another site. (The injected script registers in the MAIN
 *     FRAME ONLY, which is the first line of defence; this host check is the
 *     second, and it holds even against a page that reaches the bridge
 *     directly instead of going through the script.)
 *  3. Nothing here reads the vault or shows UI — that is the ViewModel's
 *     decision ([com.roombrowser.browser.BrowserViewModel]). The bridge is
 *     silent to the page either way, and a LOCKED vault never starts a
 *     biometric prompt on page focus; at most the ViewModel may show the
 *     offer sheet's locked variant, whose only action is the user's own tap.
 *  4. No argument is ever logged.
 *
 * THREADING: engine callbacks may arrive on the engine's own threads, so each
 * call hops to the main thread inside [main] before validation; the session
 * URL it validates against is readable from any thread, which is what makes
 * the hop safe. Throttle fields are therefore confined to the main thread.
 *
 * LIFETIME: the host keeps one bridge per session in a weak map, so this
 * object holds its session only through a [WeakReference] — a destroyed
 * session releases its bridge rather than being kept alive by it.

/**
 * INJECTED half of the password-manager page bridge — a SEPARATE
 * document-start script (installed by ProfileEngine.configure, independent of
 * the device shim) that provides the page-side detection and fill logic the
 * native [RoomVaultBridge] calls back into.
 *
 * Scope, by design:
 *  - MAIN FRAME ONLY (`window.top === window.self`): embedded third-party
 *    login widgets inside iframes are out of scope — the native host check
 *    would compare an iframe's host against the top page anyway, and filling
 *    across frame boundaries is a phishing vector we simply do not open.
 *    Cross-origin iframe logins are therefore NOT detected, by choice.
 *  - OFFER = focus/click on an `input[type=password]`.
 *  - SAVE = a login form being submitted, whatever path the page uses:
 *      1. the DOM `submit` event — native submits and `form.requestSubmit()`;
 *      2. a capture-phase `click` on a submit control (`input[type=submit]`,
 *         `input[type=image]`, `button[type=submit]`, and a `<button>` with
 *         no type attribute, whose default IS submit) inside a form — the
 *         shape of nearly every "Sign in" button, including the ones whose
 *         form handler preventDefaults and posts with fetch;
 *      3. `Enter` in a password field (SPAs routinely consume the key and
 *         post the form themselves, so no DOM event ever reaches us);
 *      4. the form's own `submit()` / `requestSubmit()` (a scripted
 *         `submit()` bypasses the submit event entirely);
 *      5. `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send` WHILE a password field
 *         we filled is still recent — the SPA login that reads the field and
 *         POSTs JSON, with no DOM signal at all.
 *
 * Why 2/3/5 are deliberately narrow: `click`, `keydown` and `fetch` fire for
 * everything on a page (toggles, search-as-you-type, analytics), so the click
 * path accepts only genuine submit controls, and the network path requires a
 * fill made by us within RECENT_FILL_MS. Paths 1 and 4 are exact signals and
 * are never gated.
 *
 * STILL NOT DETECTED — the honest list, so nobody mistakes this for total
 * coverage: cross-origin iframe logins; canvas/WebGL-drawn login UIs (there
 * are no input elements to observe); a page that collects the password
 * without any of the five signals above (e.g. keeps keystrokes in a variable
 * and posts from a Web Worker or WebSocket); a page that replaces
 * `window.fetch` / `XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send` AFTER this script has run
 * (we wrap once, at document start — re-wrapping on every assignment would be
 * an arms race we lose anyway); and a submit from a password field that was
 * never focused, clicked or filled through anything we can see.
 *
 * Robustness rules: everything is wrapped in try/catch — a broken page must
 * still load; nothing is ever written to the console (no spam); the script is
 * idempotent under re-injection (a reconfigure replaces the document-start
 * handler, and the install guard makes a double injection a no-op anyway —
 * which is also why the prototype/`fetch` wrappers need no second guard).
 *
 * Username heuristics: within the password field's form (falling back to the
 * whole document), the text/email/tel inputs BEFORE the password field are
 * ranked — autocomplete/name/id/placeholder hints like "username", "email",
 * "login", "account", plus a type=email bonus — and the best-scoring one is
 * remembered as the username field for the fill.
 *
 * Fill protocol: `window.__roomVaultFill(payload)` where payload is a JSON
 * string `{"u": username, "p": password}` (JSON-quoted by the native side —
 * values are never naively interpolated into JS). The fill writes through
 * the input prototype's native value setter and dispatches input/change
 * events so framework-driven pages (React et al.) register the values, and it
 * starts the post-fill window that arms detection path 5. The element
 * references captured at request time are used when still attached;
 * otherwise detection re-runs against the live document.
