/**
 * NATIVE half of the dApp wallet bridge, exposed to page JS as
 * `window.RoomWallet` (see [RoomWalletScript] for the injected half and
 * [WalletBridgeProtocol] for the codec). One bridge per WebView, built by
 * the integrator alongside the document-start script install.
 *
 * PROTOCOL (what page JS can call — nothing else is exported):
 *  - `RoomWallet.request(json)` — one bridge call. Returns "" immediately;
 *    the answer is pushed asynchronously with
 *    `evaluateJavascript("window.__roomWalletResponse(id, resultJson,
 *    errorCode, errorMessage)")` once the engine settles it (or the RPC
 *    relay completes).
 *
 * SECURITY MODEL — the bridge never trusts the page (mirrors
 * RoomVaultBridge):
 *  1. Only [request] is reachable from JS, and every payload is parsed by
 *     the codec into typed calls or typed errors — never an exception.
 *  2. Every call hops to the MAIN thread first, then the WebView's OWN
 *     current URL supplies the host and origin for the contract
 *     [DappRequest] — a page's claimed origin is metadata only and params
 *     never carry a trusted domain. Solana/Aptos/Sui/Tron Connect calls
 *     carry no origin claim at all: the verified host IS the host.
 *  3. Anti-flood: a 300ms minimum gap per (host, method) and at most 8
 *     concurrent pending calls per host — the OLDEST is auto-rejected with
 *     4001 when a 9th arrives, so a hostile page cannot pile prompts onto
 *     the confirmation queue.
 *  4. Nothing is ever logged.
 *
 * ROUTING:
 *  - kind "rpc" (read-only EVM calls) is relayed to the chain's ACTIVE
 *    network RPC via [JsonRpcClient] (8s timeouts, Dispatchers.IO inside
 *    the client) — no prompt is needed for reads; offline maps to 4901
 *    CHAIN_DISCONNECTED. The engine is not involved.
 *  - kind "request" is answered WITHOUT a prompt whenever it can be:
 *    already-permitted Connects auto-approve silently
 *    ([WalletEngineApi.isDappPermitted] with `eth_requestAccounts` for EVM,
 *    `enable` for Cosmos, `connect` for the other families), `eth_accounts`
 *    returns the permitted address list (empty while not permitted — never a
 *    prompt), Keplr's `getKey` answers for a permitted host only (4100
 *    otherwise), and `disconnect` revokes the host's permission for the
 *    calling chain. Everything else becomes a contract [DappRequest] (UUID
 *    id) submitted to the engine queue; the outcome settles the page promise.
 *  - A null [engineProvider] (engine not bound) answers 4900 DISCONNECTED
 *    for wallet-level calls; the RPC relay works regardless.
 *
 * THREADING: `@JavascriptInterface` arrives on WebView's JavaBridge thread;
 * WebView state is main-thread only, so every call hops inside [main].
 * The engine settles outcomes on the main thread (contract), and [finish]
 * re-checks the looper defensively. All bookkeeping maps are confined to
 * the main thread.
 *
 * LIFETIME: the WebView holds the interface object strongly, so the
 * interface holds the WebView only through the [webViewRef]
 * [WeakReference] — a destroyed engine releases its bridge.
