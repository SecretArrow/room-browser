/**
 * User-Agent presets.
 *
 * Every preset is an Android/mobile identity: the browser runs on a phone, so
 * the curated list offers mobile browsers only, and a preset says which *mobile
 * browser* a profile claims to be. A [Device] is the richer sibling — it says
 * which handset the profile claims to be and also decides the platform
 * version, build id, memory, core count and GPU strings the profile reports —
 * so when both are configured the device wins, and the settings screen clears
 * one when the other is chosen.
 *
 * Desktop identities are deliberately NOT presets. Claiming a desktop browser
 * on a phone is a rendering-mode choice, not an identity: it goes with a wide
 * viewport and no overview zoom, and it is per site, not per profile. That is
 * what the per-site "Desktop mode" toggle is for, and the UA it applies lives
 * in [UserAgents.desktopModeUserAgent] rather than in [UserAgents.all].
 *
 * What this changes is the identity a site is told, not the machine. Screen
 * size, viewport size, devicePixelRatio and the layout that follows from them
 * always report the real device, because a page laid out for a viewport the
 * phone does not have renders wrong. See SECURITY.md for the full list of
 * what is and is not presented.
 *
 * VERSIONS. A preset is only worth having if it is a string some real browser
 * actually sends: a malformed UA is *more* fingerprintable than the WebView
 * default, which is the opposite of the point. So every token here is a real
 * one — the presets whose identity is Chrome carry a real 4-part
 * Chrome-for-Android build, the Firefox presets carry the single Gecko token
 * Firefox for Android sends, and no preset invents a vendor token no browser
 * emits. The Chromium generation those Chrome-identity presets claim is the
 * one the device catalogue ships (see [Devices]), so a profile on a preset and
 * a profile on a device do not tell the same site two different stories about
 * the same app. A vendor preset is the deliberate exception: its own release
 * token and the Chromium build underneath it are a pair, and it keeps the pair
 * its browser really sends rather than half-bumping one token into a release
 * that never shipped.
