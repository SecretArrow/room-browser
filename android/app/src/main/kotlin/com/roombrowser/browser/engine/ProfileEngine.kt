/**
 * Profile engine — configures engine sessions for exactly ONE profile per
 * process, ON TOP OF the engine-agnostic facade [EngineHost].
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IS STILL HERE AT ALL. Everything below the facade — which
 * concrete engine, how its settings are spelled, what a per-profile data
 * directory is called — is the engine adapter's business now. What is left
 * here is the part that is PRODUCT POLICY: which scripts this app installs
 * into every page, how desktop mode interacts with the device shim, and the
 * once-per-process binding contract the rest of the app calls. That policy is
 * written once, against the facade, and both editions get it.
 *
 * ISOLATION MODEL (see PROFILE_ISOLATION.md for the full write-up):
 *  - [bindProcessToProfile] is called ONCE, before the first session is
 *    created in the ':browser' process. This gives every profile its own
 *    on-disk cookie jar, localStorage, IndexedDB, service workers and HTTP
 *    cache. How that is enforced differs per edition — a WebView data
 *    directory suffix in one, a GeckoRuntime's context id in the other — and
 *    that difference no longer appears here: the facade's [EngineHost.bind]
 *    carries the same once-per-process contract both editions implement.
 *  - The suffix is derived from the immutable profile UUID (never the name).
 *  - Switching profiles destroys the engine tree and RESTARTS the ':browser'
 *    process (ProfileSwitchExecutor) because the binding is process-wide and
 *    cannot be changed at runtime.
