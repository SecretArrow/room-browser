/**
 * Validates the sub-resource blocker's SCRIPT asset against the Kotlin that
 * feeds it, without running an engine.
 *
 * WHY THIS TEST EXISTS. [BridgeManifestTest] guards the manifest and
 * [BridgeScriptsTest] guards the page bridge. This guards `blocker.js` against
 * `GeckoEngineHost.kt`, because everything that crosses between them is a
 * string agreed on by convention: a port name, two message types, and ten
 * field names inside a JSON object. No compiler checks any of it.
 *
 * THE FAILURE THIS IS WRITTEN AGAINST IS SILENT IN THE WORST DIRECTION. Rename
 * a field on one side and the other side reads `undefined`; `new Set(undefined
 * || [])` is an EMPTY set, and a blocker with an empty set is not an error --
 * it is a blocker that allows every request while the app logs a successful
 * push, the dashboard counts nothing, and the user's shields appear to be on.
 * The same is true of the port name (the port simply never opens) and of the
 * category strings (the app drops the report). Every one of those is a text
 * mismatch, and every one of them costs an emulator run to find otherwise.
 *
 * Deliberately a text scan rather than a parse: the JVM unit-test classpath has
 * no JSON implementation and no JS engine, so neither file can be executed or
 * decoded here. What CAN be checked is that the two sides still spell the
 * contract the same way, and that is the whole subject of this file.
