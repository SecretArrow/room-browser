/**
 * Reads the password file that other browsers export.
 *
 * WHY A CSV READER AND NOT A LIBRARY. Chrome, Brave, Edge and Firefox can only
 * hand a user their passwords as a CSV: none of them will write our format, and
 * Android gives no way for one app to read another app's password store. So the
 * import path is a file the user exported themselves, and the only thing that
 * can be done with it is parse it. A CSV library would be a dependency for one
 * screen; the format is small enough to read here and the parsing rules that
 * matter (quoting, embedded newlines, embedded commas) are the ones written
 * down below rather than the ones a library happens to implement.
 *
 * THE COLUMNS ARE FOUND BY NAME, NEVER BY POSITION. This is the whole reason
 * one parser can serve four browsers: Chrome and Brave write
 * `name,url,username,password,note`, Firefox writes
 * `url,username,password,httpRealm,formActionOrigin,guid,timeCreated,...`, and
 * Edge writes Chrome's shape. A positional reader would import Firefox's
 * `httpRealm` as a password. Any column we do not know is ignored rather than
 * rejected, so a new browser adding a column does not break the import.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES, LOUDLY. Two kinds of row cannot become a Room Browser
 * login and are counted instead of imported:
 *
 *  - a Firefox row whose password is encrypted (`moz_ciphertext`, written when
 *    the export was taken with a primary password set). Those bytes are not a
 *    password and cannot be decrypted without NSS's `key4.db` and the master
 *    password, so importing them would store a string that fills a login form
 *    with garbage. The user is told how many rows to re-export without a
 *    primary password.
 *  - a row with no usable web URL. This is not a corner case: Chrome's own
 *    export carries `android://<hash>@<package>/` rows for saved app
 *    credentials, Firefox exports `about:` and `moz-extension:` origins, and a
 *    URL cell can simply be blank. None of them is a site the in-page filler
 *    can ever match, so they are counted as unsupported rather than imported
 *    as a login that never appears.
 *
 * The counters exist so the screen can say "412 imported, 30 skipped because
 * they were encrypted" instead of quietly importing less than the file held.
 * A silent partial import is the failure mode that matters here: the user
 * concludes their passwords are safe in the app and deletes the CSV.
