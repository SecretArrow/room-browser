/**
 * The failover primitive, tested without a network.
 *
 * `firstWorking` takes the call as a lambda, so every case here is decided by
 * what the endpoints "answer" — which is the point: what these tests pin is
 * WHICH endpoint the chain decides to try, never whether some public host is
 * up today. A test that needed a live RPC would be a test that fails for
 * reasons that have nothing to do with this class.
