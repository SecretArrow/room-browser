/**
 * Runs a deferred task for real: one headless WebView on the task's own
 * profile, the agent loop, and the answer stored back on the row.
 *
 * IT ONLY WORKS IN ':browser', and that is a fact about the engine rather than
 * a preference. The WebView data directory is chosen ONCE per process
 * ([ProfileEngine.bindProcessToProfile] calls `setDataDirectorySuffix`, and the
 * suffix cannot be changed at runtime), so this process is pinned to one
 * profile's cookie jar, storage and cache. A second WebView over another
 * profile's data — or over the same one, while the user is browsing it — is the
 * one thing that must not happen. The engine that runs a task therefore belongs
 * to the process that already owns the binding, and the answer to "cannot run
 * here" is to leave the occurrence queued rather than to force a binding.
 *
 * The runner never BINDS the process: it runs on the profile the process is
 * already bound to, or it waits. Binding here would be a race the browser must
 * lose — [ProfileEngine.bindProcessToProfile] happens in BrowserActivity's
 * `onCreate`, which is strictly after this process's Application, so a task
 * that grabbed the binding first would leave the browser restarting the
 * process to claim the profile it was opened with, over and over.
 *
 * A run that cannot go ahead says exactly why, and the row keeps the reason:
 * the profile the user is browsing is not the task's, the agent is switched
 * off, no provider is configured. None of those are failures of the task, and
 * recording them as failures would make the list lie about what happened.
