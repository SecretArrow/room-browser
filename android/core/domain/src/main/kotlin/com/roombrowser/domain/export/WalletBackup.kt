/**
 * Wallet keys export — what a user saves so their coins survive losing the
 * phone.
 *
 * ## Why a separate file, and not a field in [ProfileBackup]
 *
 * A profile export is a shareable thing: users send one to themselves, or to
 * a friend, to move bookmarks and settings around. Putting the seed in it
 * would mean every one of those files silently carries the keys to every
 * coin in the wallet. Keeping the two apart means the blast radius of a
 * carelessly shared profile backup is a set of bookmarks, and the file that
 * holds the money is one the user deliberately chose to write.
 *
 * ## Why the seed is never written in the clear
 *
 * The obvious reading of "export my seed phrase to a text file" is a
 * plaintext `.txt`. That file then lands in Downloads, gets picked up by
 * cloud backup, is readable by every app holding legacy storage permission,
 * and survives deletion on flash storage — for a secret that is
 * unrecoverable once seen. So the file this class writes is a small JSON
 * envelope whose ONLY payload is a [ProfileBackup.VaultBackup] blob, sealed
 * by [PasswordVaultCrypto] under a passphrase the user picks at export time
 * (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, 210 000 iterations, then AES-256-GCM — authenticated,
 * so a wrong passphrase is a clean error rather than garbage).
 *
 * What the user gets after decrypting is exactly the readable keys document
 * they asked for: [render] is the plaintext, and it is the plaintext and
 * nothing else that goes inside the cipher.
 *
 * ## What is inside
 *
 * The recovery phrase restores every DERIVED account — they are re-derived
 * from it, so the phrase alone is a complete backup of them. Imported
 * private keys are not derived from anything, so they are carried
 * explicitly; a backup that omitted them would restore a wallet that looks
 * right and has no access to those funds.
 *
 * ## On [open]
 *
 * The read half exists now, before there is any import UI, because a backup
 * format that has never been read back has never been shown to work. The
 * export tests decrypt through this method rather than through the raw
 * cipher, so what they prove is that THIS file can be opened by THIS code.
