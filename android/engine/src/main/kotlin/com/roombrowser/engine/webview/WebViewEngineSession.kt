/**
 * One `WebView` behind the engine facade.
 *
 * IDENTITY, NOT EQUALITY -- DO NOT ADD `equals`/`hashCode`. The tab manager
 * indexes sessions in an identity map and reads it from background threads.
 * That is only sound while two distinct sessions can never compare equal,
 * which is the property a `WebView` had by inheriting identity equality, and
 * which this class keeps by overriding nothing. An implementation that added
 * value equality would make two live tabs collide in that map, and the failure
 * would appear as one tab's state being applied to another -- far from the
 * cause. The reasoning is carried over verbatim from the WebView edition's tab
 * manager (TabManager.kt:48-67, over `ConcurrentHashMap<WebView, EngineEntry>`),
 * where it was written down the first time.
 *
 * THE URL IS A SECURITY BOUNDARY, NOT A CONVENIENCE. [url] is a `@Volatile`
 * mirror published ONLY from the two callbacks that mean "the main frame
 * COMMITTED a document" -- `doUpdateVisitedHistory` and `onPageFinished` -- and
 * never read back from `WebView.getUrl()` at an arbitrary moment. Those two are
 * what `getUrl()` itself would have returned, which is the value this replaces:
 * `RoomVaultBridge.validatedHost` anchors on `getUrl()` today
 * (WebClients.kt:806-807), and the wallet and vault bridges above decide
 * whether to answer a page from [url], so it has to name the document that is
 * actually live and nothing else. NOTHING is published at navigation start:
 * see `onPageStarted` below for why the start url is deliberately a different
 * signal. `getUrl()` IS still read in exactly one place -- the certificate-frame
 * comparison below -- because that is a comparison of urls the engine itself
 * recorded, not a trust decision.
 *
 * THREADING. `url`, `title`, `progress` and the two history flags are written
 * by engine callbacks (main thread, via the clients below) and read from any
 * thread, hence `@Volatile` on every one of them. Every command is callable
 * from any thread and is marshalled to the main thread by [runOnMain], because
 * EVERY `WebView` method is main-thread only -- unlike GeckoView, which takes
 * its commands from the thread you call them on.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE PORTS. `ProfileEngine.configure`/`applyDesktopMode`
 * (ProfileEngine.kt:206-312, 400-427), the `WebViewClient`/`WebChromeClient`
 * surface of `WebClients.kt`, the WebView factory and destroy path of
 * `BrowserViewModel.createWebView`/`destroyWebViewQuiet`
 * (BrowserViewModel.kt:1288-1333, 1398-1419), and
 * `saveEngineStateBeforeDestroy` (BrowserViewModel.kt:1452-1456).

         * attempt -- ONLY through this deprecated signature. The default

         * entirely: CI proved exactly that for the upgrade path
         * (BrowserNavigationE2eTest: the https attempt started, the back/forward
         * controls lit up, and then nothing -- no error surface, no recovery).
         *
         * The app's own override existed ONLY to consume its upgrade-fallback
         * registry and deliberately did not report, because that registry lived
         * in this class. The registry now lives above the facade, where it is
         * fed by [onPageError], so this callback has to report or the fallback
         * it used to trigger is unreachable on those stacks. A stack that calls
         * BOTH signatures reports the failure twice; the caller's registry is
         * consume-based (it removes the entry it matches), so the second report
         * matches nothing and changes nothing, and the app's own error state is
         * a plain assignment. The alternative -- reporting from one signature
         * only -- silently loses the failure on half the devices.
         *
         * IS IT TOP LEVEL? This signature carries no frame flag, and an
         * earlier version of this method answered `true` unconditionally --
         * which is a claim it cannot support. The app paints a full-screen
         * error surface for a top-level failure, so that answer let a
         * SUB-RESOURCE failure (a blocked image, a font that never loaded)
         * paint a full-screen error over a perfectly healthy page. The
         * comparison below is the honest answer available here: the failure is
         * top-level exactly when it names the main frame being tracked, and
         * anything else -- a different URL, or no URL at all -- is not, which

         *

         * it stopped the load and destroyed the transport.
         *
