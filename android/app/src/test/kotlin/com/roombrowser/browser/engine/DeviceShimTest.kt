/**
 * The shim's contract. The JavaScript itself is exercised against a browser
 * -shaped context outside the JVM; what a unit test can hold down is the
 * splicing: every placeholder filled, nothing left behind, and a value that
 * cannot break out of the string literal it is written into.
 *
 * The WebRTC predicate is held down the same way, by asserting the text of the
 * one function that makes the decision rather than by running it: there is no
 * JavaScript engine on this classpath, and pinning the decision where it is
 * written is what keeps the event filter and the SDP stripper from drifting
 * apart. A change to the predicate therefore fails these tests on purpose.
