/**
 * MULTI-PROCESS NOTE: this class is the application for BOTH processes —
 * the default one and `:browser` (see the manifest). [onCreate] therefore
 * runs twice, and each process builds its own [AppGraph] on purpose
 * (per-process WebView data dir, wallet and vault sessions).
 *
 * WorkManager is the exception: it must have ONE owner. Without
 * [Configuration.Builder.setDefaultProcessName] every process gets its own
 * `WorkManagerImpl` driving the same shared `androidx.work.workdb`, and the
 * retention purge could then execute inside `:browser` — the process
 * ProfileSwitchExecutor kills outright on a profile switch, which would
 * tear down a write transaction mid-flight. The scheduling call is gated
 * on the same check so only the owning process enqueues.
