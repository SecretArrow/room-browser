/**
 * The WebView implementation of [EngineHost].
 *
 * ONE PROCESS, ONE PROFILE, AND HERE THAT IS ENFORCED BY ANDROID RATHER THAN BY
 * US. `WebView.setDataDirectorySuffix` is the whole isolation mechanism -- it
 * gives the suffix's profile its own cookie jar, localStorage, IndexedDB,
 * service workers, HTTP cache and Web SQL -- and it is settable EXACTLY ONCE
 * PER PROCESS: a second call throws, and there is no way to undo or retarget
 * one. That single platform fact is the origin of the whole two-edition
 * isolation model (see PROFILE_ISOLATION.md): [bind] succeeds the first time,
 * refuses a second bind to a DIFFERENT profile, and the caller's response to
 * that refusal is to restart the process.
 *
 * WHY THE SUFFIX IS DERIVED FROM THE PROFILE UUID, NEVER THE NAME: a name is
 * user-editable and need not be unique, so two profiles could map to one
 * directory -- which is a cookie jar shared between two identities, the exact
 * thing the suffix exists to prevent. [ProfileId.safeSuffix] is the immutable
 * id with the hyphens stripped, and it is the same identity the GeckoView
 * edition passes as its session context id, so the two editions partition
 * storage by the same key.
 *
 * This file is the port of `com.roombrowser.browser.engine.ProfileEngine`
 * (`android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/roombrowser/browser/engine/ProfileEngine.kt`)
 * plus the tab-side lifecycle that used to live in `BrowserViewModel`. Nothing
 * here is new behaviour; the citations on each member name the lines the
 * behaviour was taken from.
