/**
 * The `User-Agent` a provider is addressed with.
 *
 * Most providers never look at it, so they get the app's own identifier. One
 * does, and it is the reason this file exists: **AgentRouter answers every
 * request whose User-Agent is not the Claude Code CLI's** with
 *
 *     401 {"error":{"message":"unauthorized client detected, contact support
 *          for assistance at https://discord.gg/HgekCyHJqB"},
 *          "type":"unauthorized_client_error"}
 *
 * Established against `https://agentrouter.org/v1/messages` by varying ONLY
 * this header: `curl/8.5.0` and `okhttp/4.12.0` both draw the refusal, while a
 * CLI-shaped value gets the request accepted and rejected later on the API key
 * alone ([AgentHttpException] 401 "invalid token"). So the header — not the
 * key, not the body shape — is what that gate reads, and no amount of correct
 * Anthropic message translation reaches the model without it.
 *
 * The server matches loosely. Accepted: `claude-cli/9.9.9 (external, cli)`,
 * `claude-cli/1.0.60 (external, cli) extra`, `claude-cli/1.0.60(external,cli)`,
 * even `claude-cli/ (external, cli)`. Refused: `claude-cli/1.0.60` (no
 * suffix), `claude-cli`, `claude-code/1.0.0`, `Claude-CLI/1.0.60`,
 * `Mozilla/5.0 claude-cli/2.0.0`, and any change of case in the suffix. So the
 * requirement is the presence of `claude-cli/` AND a case-SENSITIVE
 * `(external, cli)`, anywhere in the value, and the version is ignored —
 * [CLAUDE_CLI] is the canonical spelling, not a load-bearing exact string.
 *
 * Two consequences worth stating plainly rather than discovering later:
 *
 *  - This identifies the app as another vendor's client. That is what reaching
 *    this provider requires, and it is the account holder's decision to make —
 *    but it is the kind of thing a provider may treat as a terms violation and
 *    close the account over, so it is opt-in by HOST ([CLI_ONLY_HOSTS]) and
 *    never applied to providers that do not ask for it.
 *  - It is a client-identity shim, not an authentication bypass: the API key is
 *    still required and still checked by the provider.
 *
 * Pure (no Android, no HTTP) so the whole rule is covered by the core unit
 * tests rather than only by a live call.

     * Chrome for Android, deliberately, and never the app's own name: a

     * refuse a client it does not recognise, and `RoomBrowser-Agent/1.0`
     * announces a client nobody has ever heard of. The identity here is the
     * same one [com.roombrowser.domain.model.UserAgents] hands a page, so the
     * app does not present one name to a web server and a different one to an
     * API. It stays a fixed literal rather than a settings lookup: this is the
     * transport's identity, not a per-profile browsing preference, and a user
     * choosing a UA preset must not silently re-point it at their AI provider.
