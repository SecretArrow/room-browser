/**
 * Pins WHICH tools may run while the chat's tab is in the background.
 *
 * This is the one decision of the per-tab binding whose wrong answer is not
 * visible on screen. A navigation-capable tool let loose on a background
 * engine can wedge that tab permanently (see [MOVES_THE_PAGE]); a tool held
 * back by mistake makes the agent stall for a reason nobody can see. Both are
 * one Set entry away, and neither is reachable from a JVM test that drives
 * the executor itself — so the classification is a value a test can hold
 * against the tool list, and this is that test.
 *
 * Three sets, not two, because "needs the tab on screen" has two unrelated
 * reasons: [MOVES_THE_PAGE] must not start a load on a detached engine, and
 * [NEEDS_SCREEN_TAB] acts on the page the USER is looking at rather than on
 * this chat's own engine. They are disjoint, and together with
 * [staysInBackground] they must cover the catalogue exactly.
 *
 * Every test here ends on a VOID-returning Truth call on purpose: a Kotlin
 * function whose last expression has a value compiles to a non-void method,
 * and JUnit4 then refuses the whole class instead of running the rest of it.
 * `containsExactly…` and `containsAtLeast…` return `Ordered`, so they are
 * never the last line.
