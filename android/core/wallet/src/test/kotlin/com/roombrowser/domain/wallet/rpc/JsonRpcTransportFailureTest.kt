/**
 * How a transport failure becomes a [WalletException].
 *
 * The failure is injected by an OkHttp interceptor rather than by a real TLS
 * server, and that is deliberate: what is under test here is the MAPPING — the
 * decision that an `SSLException` is a certificate problem worth naming and an
 * ordinary `IOException` is not. That OkHttp reports an expired chain, an
 * untrusted issuer and a hostname mismatch as `SSLException` subclasses is a
 * fact about OkHttp, not about this client, and it is the fact the mapping is
 * written against; a test that stood up its own bad-certificate server would
 * be testing the JDK's TLS stack instead.
 *
 * Interceptors added at the application level sit outside OkHttp's connection
 * machinery, so what they throw propagates out of `execute()` unwrapped and
 * untouched — which is exactly the shape the mapping has to handle.
