/*
 * Room Browser bridge -- PAGE WORLD half.
 *
 * This runs in the page's own JavaScript world at document_start, before any
 * page script, in every frame. That is not a preference: it defines the two
 * globals the page calls (window.RoomWallet, window.RoomVault) and hosts the
 * device shim, whose whole purpose is to be installed before the page measures
 * anything. An isolated-world script cannot write those -- its window is a
 * different object -- so this half must be the page world.
 *
 * The cost of running here is that there is no `browser.*` API: a page-world
 * script cannot reach the extension APIs at all. That is what isolated.js is
 * for, and the two halves talk over window.postMessage.
 *
 * MESSAGES USE PRIMITIVE-ONLY PAYLOADS on purpose. A string or a number
 * crosses the world boundary intact; a structured object arrives wrapped, and
 * the receiving side's property access silently stops seeing what was sent.

  /*
   * ===================== the page-callable globals =====================
   *
   * window.RoomWallet and window.RoomVault live here, and this is the whole
   * reason the GeckoView edition needs a page-world half at all. In the WebView
   * edition they were `addJavascriptInterface` registrations; that API has no
   * GeckoView equivalent, so the globals are written by hand and both of their
   * halves -- the page-visible shape and the upward envelope -- are reproduced
   * from the WebView edition's native objects (see WebViewPageBridges.kt, which
   * documents the same contract from the other side).
   *
   * WHAT MUST NOT DRIFT, because the app-side parsers are shared between the
   * two editions and neither was changed for this:
   *
   *   window.RoomWallet.request(json)             -> channel "RoomWallet"
   *     {"method":"request","payload":<json>}        and RETURNS ""
   *   window.RoomVault.requestCredentials(h, href) -> channel "RoomVault"
   *     {"method":"requestCredentials","host":..,"href":..}
   *   window.RoomVault.reportCredential(h, u, p)   -> channel "RoomVault"
   *     {"method":"reportCredential","host":..,"username":..,"password":..}
   *
   * The return value is the empty string for the same reason the WebView
   * edition returns it: answers are asynchronous and arrive as an eval of
   * `window.__roomWalletResponse(...)`, so a caller must not read the return as
   * an answer.
   *
   * Arguments go through `arg`, which mirrors the Kotlin `String?` parameters
   * they used to cross: a number or boolean becomes its string form because
   * that is what the platform bridge did, and undefined/null becomes a JSON
   * null rather than the string "null", which is what `JSONObject.NULL` wrote.
   * The receiving side treats null as absent (`stringOrNull`), and the vault's
   * host check returns early on it -- so getting this wrong would turn a
   * missing host into the literal string "null" and then into a host-check
   * failure rather than a drop.
   *
   * A PAGE CAN CALL THESE, AND THAT IS NOT A NEW CAPABILITY. It could call the
   * WebView edition's interfaces just as directly; the trust anchor is the
   * native side comparing the claimed host against the session's own URL
   * (WalletBridge.dispatch, RoomVaultBridge.validatedHost), not the secrecy of
   * this entry point. The one thing the page gains here is that it can also
   * forge the `__roomToIso` envelope directly instead of going through these
   * objects -- which reaches exactly the same native method with exactly the
   * same validation, so there is nothing behind it to protect.
