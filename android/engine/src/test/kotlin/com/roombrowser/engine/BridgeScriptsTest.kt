/**
 * Validates the page bridge's SCRIPT assets against the native side, without
 * running an engine.
 *
 * WHY THIS TEST EXISTS. [BridgeManifestTest] guards the manifest. This guards
 * the three files the manifest points at -- `main.js`, `isolated.js` and
 * `GeckoEngineSession.kt` -- because the contracts between them are written in
 * no compiler's language. A marker name, a port name and a message type are
 * strings agreed on by convention across JavaScript, a manifest and Kotlin,
 * and NOTHING in the build checks that the three agree.
 *
 * That is not a hypothetical. The bug this file is modelled on: `main.js`
 * listened for `__roomToIso`, re-labelled it as `__roomFromPage` and forwarded
 * it -- and **no code anywhere produced `__roomToIso`**. The listener was
 * complete, the relay was correct, the manifest was (after its own fix)
 * correct, and the bridge was dead: nothing defined `window.RoomWallet`, so a
 * dApp's `eth_requestAccounts` was answered `4900 Wallet bridge is unavailable`
 * by the page-side shim, twelve retries deep, forever. Nothing logged a
 * problem from the app's side. The only symptom was a page that never called
 * the bridge, and the only place that surfaced was an emulator job.
 *
 * So these assert the CONTRACT, not the presence of a file: every cross-world
 * marker must appear on BOTH sides it crosses, and the port name and message
 * types must agree between the JavaScript that speaks them and the Kotlin that
 * answers them. Like [BridgeManifestTest], a text scan rather than a parse --
 * the JVM unit-test classpath has no JS engine and no JSON implementation.
