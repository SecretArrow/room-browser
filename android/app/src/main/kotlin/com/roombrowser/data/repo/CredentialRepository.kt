/**
 * Per-profile password-manager repository: Room rows + per-profile vault
 * encryption (security.VaultCrypto / [VaultCryptor]).
 *
 * Security invariants:
 *  - the DAO sees ONLY ciphertext ([CredentialEntity.passwordEnc]); the
 *    plaintext password exists in memory solely between the UI/caller and
 *    the [SavedCredential] handed back, and nothing is ever logged;
 *  - every read/write is scoped to the profile it was called with — a row
 *    belonging to another profile is invisible and undeletable through this
 *    profile's calls (credentials are profile data, like tabs and history);
 *  - all suspend work runs on [Dispatchers.IO] (Keystore + Room are blocking).
 *
 * SESSION LOCK POLICY — "ask per session, not per action": the vault starts
 * LOCKED in every process. The UI layer runs its biometric / device-credential
 * gate ONCE and then calls [unlock]; every repository call after that works
 * without re-prompting until [lock] (explicit lock, background timeout, ...).
 * The "background timeout" is [autoLockTimeoutMs] (DEFAULT 5 minutes) and it
 * is NOT sliding: the watchdog re-locks the vault [autoLockTimeoutMs] after
 * the unlock, even if the vault is being used the whole time. That is the
 * point — a sliding timer would let a busy session hold plaintext key
 * material indefinitely, which is exactly what a timeout exists to bound.
 * Within the window nothing re-prompts, so the per-session feel is unchanged
 * for ordinary use (open the vault, fill a login, save a login: seconds).
 * Conversely, EVERY API (reads, saves, deletes, import/export) throws
 * [VaultLockedException] while locked — there is no unlocked back door. Both
 * processes (:browser + default) hold their own lock state, so unlocking the
 * manager UI in the main process does not silently unlock the ':browser'
 * process' copy.
 *
 * AUTO-LOCK LIMITATION (honest): the watchdog is a coroutine `delay` on a
 * process-lived scope. Android freezes backgrounded processes, so on a
 * device that is not in active use the re-lock lands LATE (it runs on thaw),
 * never early and never never. The timeout therefore bounds the plaintext
 * window of an ACTIVE process; process death remains the hard bound.
 *
 * [autoLockScope] is injectable so tests can drive the watchdog with virtual
 * time; production never passes it. The repository is a singleton in the
 * AppGraph, so the default scope's lifetime matches the process.
