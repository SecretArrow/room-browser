/**
 * Assembles the message list for ONE turn.
 *
 * Pure function (no Android deps) so the ORDER is unit-testable on the JVM.
 * The order is the contract, and every part of it is load-bearing:
 *
 *   system | prior turns | page snapshot | standing context | attachments | request
 *
 * The standing context is re-sent on EVERY turn rather than once when it was
 * written, because a provider keeps no memory between turns: a context that
 * only rides the first request is gone by the third.
 *
 * It sits BELOW the page snapshot so "this is my standing instruction" is the
 * most recent thing the model read before the actual request, and ABOVE the
 * request itself so the request remains the last word.
 *
 * It is a USER message, never merged into the system prompt: the system prompt
 * is the app's own instruction set, and text the user can retype at any time
 * does not belong in the slot that defines what the agent fundamentally is.
 *
 * The switch and the text are checked separately on purpose. [AgentSettings]
 * keeps "off" and "empty" as distinct states so muting a context does not mean
 * deleting it, which means a switch left ON over blank text is reachable — and
 * must send nothing rather than an empty "Standing context:" block.
 *
 * [pageSnapshot] is null when the user did not include the page.
 *
 * Returns a MUTABLE list, and that is part of the contract rather than a
 * convenience: [AgentLoop.runTurn] appends the tool calls and tool results it
 * makes to this very list as the turn proceeds, so the caller's history and
 * the model's history stay the same object. Handing it an immutable list does
 * not compile — which is how this signature was caught.

     *     is consulted, not the model and not the user. It is first because
     *     it is the only rule that is not a decision: it is the user having
     *     said they do not want to be asked. It is reachable from the
     *     approval prompt's third answer as well as from settings, since the
     *     moment a person wants it is the moment they are being interrupted.
     *  1. The **local decision gate** (see [AgentSettings.decisionGate]), when
     *     the user has pointed it at an Ollama decision model. It answers
     *     allow / confirm / deny, and only the first and last are settled
     *     here — "confirm" means the model declined to decide alone, which is
     *     exactly what rule 2 is for.
     *  2. **Confirm actions**, the blanket Allow/Deny prompt that has always
     *     been there. Its third answer, "Always allow", turns rule 0 on.
     *
     * So the gate can only ever *add* a decision. Turning rule 1 on never
     * takes away a prompt the user asked for, with one deliberate exception:
     * an action the blanket rule would have asked about can now run unasked,
     * because the local model read the user's own policy and said it was
     * routine. That is the entire point of the feature, and it is why the
     * policy text is the user's to write.
     *
     * A gate that is switched on and cannot answer is NOT an error the user
     * has to clear — the turn continues under rule 2, and the chat says so.
     * The consequence is worth stating plainly, and `SECURITY.md` does: with
     * **Confirm actions off and the gate unreachable, actions run ungated**,
     * exactly as they did before this feature existed. Confirm actions is the
     * switch that gives a hard guarantee; this one buys fewer interruptions.
